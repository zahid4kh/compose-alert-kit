Toastify is a lightweight, composable toast message library for Jetpack Compose that makes showing toast messages simple and state-driven. It provides a clean, declarative API that integrates seamlessly with Compose's reactive paradigm.

## Features

- üîÑ **Composable API** - Fully integrated with Jetpack Compose's lifecycle
- üß† **State-driven** - Uses Compose state to trigger toast messages naturally
- üö´ **No duplicates** - Automatically cancels previous toasts when showing new ones
- üîç **Context-aware** - Automatically retrieves the current context
- üß© **Simple integration** - Just a single line of code to get started


## Basic Usage

Using Toastify is straightforward:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    // Create a toast state that manages showing toasts
    val toastifyState = rememberToastify()
    
    Button(onClick = {
        toastifyState.show("Button clicked!")
    }) {
        Text("Click Me")
    }
}
```

### Customizing Toast Duration

You can specify the duration of your toast message:

```kotlin
Button(onClick = {
    toastifyState.show("This is a long toast", Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
}) {
    Text("Show Long Toast")
}
```


## Common Pitfalls

### ‚ùå Direct Instantiation

**Don't do this:**
```kotlin
// This won't work! The toast will never show.
ToastifyState().show("This won't be visible")
```

**Why it fails:** The `ToastState` needs to be remembered by Compose and connected to a LaunchedEffect that actually shows the toast. Direct instantiation bypasses this mechanism.

**Do this instead:**
```kotlin
val toastifyState = rememberToastify()
toastifyState.show("This will work correctly")
```

### ‚ùå Wrong Scope

**Don't do this:**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyApp() {
    val toastifyState = rememberToastify()
    
    LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
        // This toast will only show once when the composition starts
        toastifyState.show("App started")
    }
}
```

**Do this instead:**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyApp() {
    val toastifyState = rememberToastify()
    
    var isFirstLaunch by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
    
    LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
        if (isFirstLaunch) {
            toastState.show("App started")
            isFirstLaunch = false
        }
    }
}
```
